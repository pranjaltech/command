Objective: Add onboarding with multi-provider and telemetry support.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Running `cmd` without args shows help text.
- `cmd config` triggers onboarding when config missing, otherwise shows help.
- Config stores provider, API key, API URL and telemetry preference; multiple providers can be saved.
- Onboarding prompts user for provider, API key, URL (with defaults), and telemetry opt-in.
- Langfuse telemetry is sent only if user enables it.
- README split into user and developer sections with contribution guidelines.
- Verification suite passes.
